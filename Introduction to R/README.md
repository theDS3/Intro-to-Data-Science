# Intro to Data Science
Welcome to the Introduction to Data Science Workshop Series! In this comprehensive guide, you'll find all the information you need to get started with our workshop series. We'll not only provide an overview of the workshops but also offer step-by-step instructions on how to install R and RStudio, the essential tools for your data science journey.

## Workshop Series Overview
Our Introduction to Data Science Workshop Series is designed for beginners who want to dive into the exciting world of data science. You'll learn the fundamentals of data analysis, data visualization, and statistical techniques using the R programming language. The series is structured into three workshops:

1) Workshop 1: Introduction to RStudio
   1) Learn the basics of R and its data structures.
   2) Understand how to read data.
   3) Get hands-on experience with basic data analysis.
      
2) Workshop 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
   1) Gain proficiency in exploratory data analysis.
   2) Learn how to create compelling data visualization.
   3) Discover how to handle missing data.

3) Workshop 3: Statistical Inference and Predictive Modelling
   1) Explore how to interpret data.
   2) Create your own prediction models.
   3) Bring everything together with a mini data science project.

Now, let's get you set up with R and RStudio for a smooth workshop experience.
